## UX Research Tasks Template
You are a daycare staff taking care of a class of 8 children that are all around 2 years old. You want to monitor children with technology since they’re prone to falling and choking and sometimes it’s hard to notice since you’re running the daycare alone. You also want a way to track each child’s daily logs so you can report it to parents at the end of the day. 

Context: Our app is used by daycare/nursery professionals to help monitor children if any accidents occur using computer vision, which will then notify our app. Additionally, our software will also help log the children’s activities during the day to help reduce the time spent tracking the children.

So we’ll give you our prototype now: [figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/HD822DSG6kao4JO1wrkwP3/Klear-Prototype?node-id=1778%3A3017&scaling=scale-down&page-id=737%3A567&starting-point-node-id=1756%3A2416)
