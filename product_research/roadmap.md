# Roadmap

This is our current roadmap that takes us through 2023. As we iterate on our monitoring software,
the roadmap will be updated to reflect new product and techincal decisions. New issues created will also be added to the roadmap.    

## Short Term

**Duration:** Q1 2023
For Q1 2023, which takes us to the end of March, we plan to complete:
- Initial user research [[issue 25]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/35)
- Use case and Tech stack research [[17]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/17)[[18]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/18)[[19]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/19)[[20]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/20)
- Demo of our tech stack and intitial build our development environments [[28]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/28)
- Complete data gathering to train ML model [[33]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/issues/33)

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Q2 2023

We intend to launch our MVP in the medium term, details include:
- 
- Complete multiple iterations of UX research [[milestone 2]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/2)
- Store and log incidents detected by ML model [[10]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/10)
- Display notifications when an incident has been detected [[8]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/8)
- Display students including their incidents and activities [[13]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/13)
- Setup ML service to recieve and assess content [[7]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/7)
- Complete CI/CD for test infastructure and app builds [[5]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/5)
- Complete pre-launch bug testing [[11]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/11)
- Complete all multi-demos and be ready to demo MVP [[4]](https://github.com/dcsil/Klear/milestone/4)

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2023
- Expand computer vision service to take in live videos as input
- Integrate product so it can be used with existing survellance cameras
- Expand hazard detection to recognize more incidents
- Test beta version of product on small daycares in Ontario

## User Research
The first iteration of our user research will be carried out during the week of Feburary 6th. We will be creating customer personas and sending out surveys to child care providers in Onatrio. The purpose of the first step is better understand the supervising difficulties of daycare providers, ensure our product addresses their need, and make pivots if necessary.

###  Feburary 6th Update
After the first iteration of user research, we got helpful feedback consisting of UI changes, grouping functionalities together, and small feature requests. However, our core hypothesis on incident detection and notification was validated by our customer. The single biggest pivot we will make is adding activity logging (eating, playing, and sleeping), in addition to accident detection in our software. This will be an additional use-case that will be reflected on the roadmap. 

## Launch Date
Prior to launch, we will have to ensure our product can integrate with existing cameras and process live video feeds. The integration process will likely take us beyond the end of this course. We plan to first approach local daycares in Toronto and install our software to their exisitng security systems. Our priority it to start our launch by finding daycares with cameras and are willing to consent to using our techonology. Once consent from the daycare, staff, and parents are given, we can then launch our product to our first real users which will estimate will be in Q4 2023.
