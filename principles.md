## Principles

### Expectations for communication
- Will use slack for communication and will regularly update the channel (group name) with any news or updates 
- Members should check slack twice a day and reply as needed
- If there are any absences then the team should be notified beforehand 
- Will also use slack to vote for meeting times 
- Weekly recurring meetings will also be scheduled, if there are any conflicts the team member should let the team know a day beforehand
- Weekly meetings will consist of status updates, planning, and any blockers
- Personal numbers and emails will also be shared in case of emergencies

### Roles and responsibilities
- Individuals should notify the team 3 days in advance if they feel that they canâ€™t finish their task on time
- Members are responsible for updating the team for any changes/updates through slack
- Members are required to attend meetings, if they are not able to, they need to make a plan to compensate for their absence
- Members are required to follow deadlines

### Work delegation
- Work will be distributed fairly across the team, tickets will be assigned and tracked on Github issues
- The team will support all members for any issues, and individual members should notify the team as soon as possible for help 
- All work should be reviewed at least by one other member before a merge and each member should complete testing before pushing
